# Poker! Proposal

## Poker is the Game! Loosing all your money is your choice.

Poker is simply a game of chance. Probably the worse game of chance you could ever play in your life. I seriously do not understand how people risk significant amounts of money on this thing. 

All that aside, the mechanics behind poker is deeply intriguing. The different ways to win and different ways to win hands separate the pros from the regular degular folk.

## Thoughts

Implementing the winning logic will be more than a bit challenging alongside implementing other features such as the bet, check, fold staples of the game. I have a bit of a clue as to how to implement it but time will still be very sticky. At the least It should check a pair & three of a kind and if both have, then take the higher winning hand.

## Phases
- ### Build Phase

The build phase is the most straightforward of them all. Build the HTML bones and sling some CSS decorations at it. Need to get card images and a poker board I guess. or make my own div board.

- ### Struggle Phase

The struggle phase is where the poker logic goes. The win conditions will be the biggest headache. But I have some thought as to how I will approach it. 

Massive stuggle most likely will ensue but that's fine.
